2. Install the Expo app onto your phone from the App store. [You can download the Expo app here].
3. Naviagte to the project folder in Terminal.
4. Run the command 'npm install'.
5. Next, run the command 'npx expo start'.
6. Open the Expo app and scan the QR displayed on screen.
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to open the app in Expo.
