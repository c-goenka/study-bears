# Bear Territory
I used React Native, Expo, and Appleâ€™s Xcode simulator to bring my high fidelity prototype to life. The prototype is compatible with iOS platforms. The design of the app is most compatible with recent iterations of the iPhone (ex. iPhoneX and above). We recommend running the app on the iPhone 12 Pro Max.

Overview of the Project (Presented by me): https://youtu.be/NISv1qQx1wA

## How to Use
In order to explore my prototype, you will need access to the Expo app (either on a phone or a computer). The easiest way to run my app is using Expo on your phone and accessing my project prototype through the QR code.

## To run our app:
1. Clone the project repo on your computer.
2. Install the Expo app onto your phone from the App store. [You can download the Expo app here].
3. Naviagte to the project folder in Terminal.
4. Run the command 'npm install'.
5. Next, run the command 'npx expo start'.
6. Open the Expo app and scan the QR displayed on screen.
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to open the app in Expo.
8. The Study Bears app should now open and display an onboarding screen.
